## Functional Requirements:-

In this project we used the concept of  Functions , Multi file programing , Arithmetic operators. 

#### The basic user-defined functions used in this project are listed below:

*  Addition - sum of two numbers are calculated.
*  Subtraction - difference between two numbers are calculated.
*  Multiplication - product of two numbers are calculated.
*  Division - The process of dividing given two values.
*  Modulus - to find the remainder between two numbers.
*  Power - allows you to raise a number to a certain exponential value .
*  Factorial - to find the function that multiplies the number by every natural number below it
*  Square - to perform the square of a number.
*  Cube - to find the cube for the given number.
*  Squareroot - to find the squareroot of the given number. 
*  Naturallog - to find the naturallog of the given number.
*  Sine - the ratio of the length of the side of the triangle opposite the angle to the length of the triangle's hypotenuse.
*  Cosine - the ratio of the length of the side next to an acute angle to the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse) in a right-angled triangle.
*  Tangent - the tangent of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side of the triangle.
